# Project 02 — Entra Tenant Baseline

## Project Overview

This project documents the baseline configuration of a Microsoft Entra ID tenant used for identity and access management labs.

The goal is to understand the current tenant structure before making configuration changes.

This includes reviewing users, groups, roles, directory synchronization, identity source, and administrative structure.

## Business Problem

Organizations need a clear understanding of their identity environment before implementing access controls, security policies, automation, or governance.

Without a tenant baseline, it can be difficult to answer basic identity questions such as:

- Which users are cloud-only?
- Which users are synced from on-premises Active Directory?
- Which groups exist?
- Which admin roles are assigned?
- Which accounts are privileged?
- What is the source of authority for identities?
- What tenant configuration should be documented before changes are made?

A clear tenant baseline helps reduce risk before implementing security controls such as Conditional Access, MFA, Privileged Identity Management, and Identity Governance.

## Project Objective

The objective of this project is to document the current Microsoft Entra ID tenant baseline.

This project will document:

- Tenant overview
- Domain type
- Identity types
- Cloud-only users
- Synced users
- Group types
- Administrative roles
- Directory sync status
- Source-of-authority notes
- Screenshot documentation standards
- Future baseline improvements

## Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates identity administration fundamentals, including:

- Microsoft Entra admin center navigation
- Tenant baseline documentation
- User inventory review
- Group inventory review
- Role and administrator review
- Hybrid identity awareness
- Source-of-authority understanding
- Public documentation safety
